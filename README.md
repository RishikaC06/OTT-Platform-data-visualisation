# OTT Platform Data visualization
I have crafted an engaging and interactive tableau story that provides insights on OTT platform by utilizing the rich **Netflix dataset** from Kaggle.
Dive deep into the data and unravel fascinating trends and patterns in consumption habits, content preferences, etc by interacting with the dashboard.
Click on the various charts to interact with them. 
Clicking on charts in the storyboard allows you to jump between different dashboards.
